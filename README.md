To fill the **Client ID** ad **Client Secret** fields, go to https://console.developers.google.com/ to create the required **OAuth client ID** credentials (read detailed instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow?hl=it)).

As **Authorized JavaScript origins** set the base URL of the site where you are installing the extension.

As **Authorized redirect URLs** set the URL of the Admin Panel.

You can also define a set of domain-based rules to automatically assign a role to a user or to force a user to use the Google Sign On, as shown below:
